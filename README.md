Data Set :
The final dataset is the result of joining two datasets from different sources. One originates from the NYC Department of Finance (Housing Sales Data), while the other comes from the NYC Department of City Planning (PLUTO and MapPLUTO). The join was made based on "Block" & "Lot", but 25% of the data from the second set was missing, leading to many NA values in the resulting dataframe.
